							What do you like best about the product?

						<div class="rev-a">
							Ease of implementation. Flexible reporting

						<div class="rev-q">
							What do you dislike about the product?
						</div>
						<div class="rev-a">
							Creating unique reports was not intuitive. At times

						</div>
						<div class="rev-q">
							Recommendations to others considering the product:
						</div>
						<div class="rev-a">
							The product should meet the bulk of your needs from
							an accounting standpoint and is flexible and for the
							most part intuitive. When implementing the product
							be sure to think through the implications of how you
							implement the product on your own and do not rely on
							Intacct to necessarily guide you down the most
							effective implementation path.
						</div>
						<div class="rev-q">
							What problems is the product solving and how is that
							benefiting you?
						</div>
						<div class="rev-a">
							A cloud based accounting software that had more
							functionality than Quickbooks.

						<div class="rev-a">
							The dashboards give you good information in one
							view. Which make it easy to track budget vs. actual
							on a rolling monthly basis. The dashboards can also
							provide one place to get 80% of your data.

						<div class="rev-q">

						<div class="rev-a">
							drilling down into the details can be difficult and

							and put on dashboards.

						<div class="rev-q">
							Recommendations to others considering the product:
						</div>
						<div class="rev-a">
							Plan properly and have your requirement clearly

						<div class="rev-a">
							Complexity around entities, line item data entry can

							It's an accounting system. Nothing more. Nothing
