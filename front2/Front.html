      <div data-ans="1">It's very easy to manage expenses and other reports.
        Very easy and convenient when billing schedules especially when using contract module.
        It's indeed helpful when you want to generate financial analysis.</div>

      <div data-ans="1">The chief benefits of using Sage Intacct are the product features and capabilities of the software.</div>
      <div data-ans="2">There is a learning curve to Sage Intacct, as it takes a while to get used to report-building features, import data template structures, etc.</div>
      <div data-ans="3">Automation. As I use features that improve automation, I see a massive benefit for my company.</div>

      <div data-ans="1">It has streamlined our data. Where we had many paper files earlier, we moved things here during my last project. We have made dashboards on it, which are direct and uncluttered. It now reduces our time for audits and improved decision-making. The best feature I liked was I could use wildcard characters like excel to search for bills.</div>
      <div data-ans="2">In-depth analyses of data using slice and dice are complex, so we export the data to PowerBI. Automating manual entries and logs for them will be a great addition to the software.</div>
      <div data-ans="3">During my last project, we set it up for the Accounting team. We were earlier manually bringing data from banks, payment gateways and manual files and collating and making reports, which are now all shifted to Sage Intacct. Now we are using it for cash management; even the HR team is also onboarded for payrolls. Manual intervention is reduced by 50%, as only one team is involved, and manual bill handling is also stopped.</div>
