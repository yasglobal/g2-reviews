The Revenue/Accounts Receivable Module makes it easy to record and recognize this revenue automatically rather than having to track it on a spreadsheet and figure out what needs to be recorded monthly.  This is a strong attribute of the software.  Secondarily, being a cloud based solutions has been very helpful when not in the office."

For example, once a cash payment has been received, the entry that recorded the invoice cannot be changed.  If you want/need to add a location or department, it can't be done.  Also, the inability to merge accounts and departments to make a more streamlined chart of accounts (especially when you inherited a mess) is frustrating.  There should be more flexibility to make changes.  I know other systems have this flexibility. "
